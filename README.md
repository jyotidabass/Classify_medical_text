# Medical-Text-Classification

The objectives of this assignment are the following:
- Choose appropriate techniques for modeling text. 
- Think about dealing with imbalanced data.

Detailed Description:
Develop predictive models that can determine, given a medical abstract, which of 5 classes it falls in.
Medical abstracts describe the current conditions of a patient. Doctors routinely scan dozens or hundreds of abstracts each day as they do their rounds in a hospital and
must quickly pick up on the salient information pointing to the patientâ€™s malady. You are trying to design assistive technology that can identify, with high precision, 
the class of problems described in the abstract. In the given dataset, abstracts from 5 different conditions have been included: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular
diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions.
The goal of this competition is to allow you to develop predictive models that can determine, given a particular medical abstract, which one of 5 classes it belongs to.
As such, the goal would be to develop the best classification model.
As we have learned in class, there are many ways to represent text as sparse vectors. Feel free to use any of the code in activities or write your own for the text processing step.
Since the dataset is imbalanced, the scoring function will be the F1-score instead of Accuracy.
